Acme-Curses-Marquee

This module implements a big, stupid, OO, curses-based, scrolling
marquee. Woooo!

Check out the included 'scrolly' test script, which has 2 independent
marquees to play with, if you'd like to see A::C::M in action before
installing the module (but don't set a font before setting some text
on a marquee).


INSTALLATION

To install this module, run the following commands:

    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make test
    make install

You'll also be needing a copy of figlet in your path.
